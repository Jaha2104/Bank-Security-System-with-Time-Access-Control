Hi There,

I am Jahanvi S Adhav

Course:-BCA(Dual)

Year:- SY   Sem-III

From:- GLS University

Location:-Ahmedabad

Skills 
Languages:- C, C++, Java
Web Devlopment:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Currently Studing:-
Language:- Java
Subject:- Introduction to Embedded System

These is My first project in my College Regarding to Subject Embedded System i used C++ programming for code and i used Arduino IDE Software for these project.

Purpose: This project aims to develop an integrated security system that provides dual-layer
protection by combining real-time perimeter monitoring with a secure, time-based access control
mechanism. Its primary purpose is to create a cost-effective solution for safeguarding sensitive areas
against unauthorized intrusion and access.

Methodology: The system is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller. For perimeter security, an
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance, triggering a multi-level alarm (using an
LED and buzzer) when objects breach predefined zones. For access control, a DS3231 RTC module
generates a dynamic password that changes every minute. User authentication is handled via a 4x4
matrix keypad, and all system status information is displayed on a 20x4 I2C LCD. A solenoid lock is
activated upon successful password verification.

Expected Outcome: The successful integration of these components is expected to result in a robust
and reliable automated system. The final outcome is a fully functional device that effectively monitors
a perimeter for intrusions while providing a highly secure, dynamic password-based entry system,
demonstrating a practical and enhanced security solution.

The main aim of this project is to develop an integrated security system that solves the limitations of
conventional single-function security devices. It addresses the problem of passive monitoring by
combining real-time perimeter intrusion detection with an active, time-based access control
mechanism. The motivation behind developing this system is to create a cost-effective solution that
provides comprehensive security for sensitive areas. By merging dual security layers into one
automated unit, the project enhances protection against unauthorized access while maintaining user
convenience through dynamic password authentication.
