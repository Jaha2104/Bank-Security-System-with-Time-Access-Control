conventional single-function security devices. It addresses the problem of passive monitoring by
combining real-time perimeter intrusion detection with an active, time-based access control
mechanism. The motivation behind developing this system is to create a cost-effective solution that
provides comprehensive security for sensitive areas. By merging dual security layers into one
automated unit, the project enhances protection against unauthorized access while maintaining user
convenience through dynamic password authentication.
